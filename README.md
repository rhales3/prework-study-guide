# <Learn to Code Prework>

## Description

I followed the instructions set out in the pre work study gide to create a website with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and using Git.
My motivation was to learn the basic of web development and further my understanding.
I built this project so I can understand the ins and outs of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so I can better follow along in class and not fall behind.
I learned that it is within my realm of understanding to code and I have more faith in myself.
